Click on a card to show it

Match all the card couples to win the game

Click on the reset icon to start a new game.

## Debugging

In the game variable are stored all game methods and properties.
You can access them in your javascript console like this:

	game.win()		<- will open the victory modal
	game.guessed = 8	<- will make you win at your next guess

## Credits


I have used a timer function from http://jsfiddle.net/fc37nckg/

and a shuffle function from: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976

The game also uses Font-Awesome and Google fonts
